**A fun, project-based guide to learning Python 3 while building real-world apps**

## What is this book about?
Python is the most widely used programming language for building data science applications. Complete with step-by-step instructions, this book contains easy-to-follow tutorials to help you learn Python and develop real-world data science projects. The “secret sauce” of the book is its curated list of topics and solutions, put together using a range of real-world projects, covering initial data collection, data analysis, and production.


This book covers the following exciting features:
* Code in Python using Jupyter and VS Code 
* Explore the basics of coding – loops, variables, functions, and classes 
* Deploy continuous integration with Git, Bash, and DVC 
* Get to grips with Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn 
* Perform data visualization with Matplotlib, Altair, and Datashader 
Create a package out of your code using poetry and test it with PyTest 
Make your machine learning model accessible to anyone with the web API

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter01.

The code will look like the following:
```
import pandas as pd

for word in 'Hello Word!'.split():
    print(word)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is aimed at new Python developers with little to no prior programming skills beyond basic computer literacy. The book doesn't require any previous background in data science or statistics either. That being said, it covers a variety of topics, from data processing to visualization, to delivery—including dashboards, building APIs, Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipelines, or a standalone package. Thus, it is also suited to experienced data scientists interested in productizing their work. For a complete novice, this book aims to cover all major parts of the data application life cycle—from Python basics to scripts, data collection and processing, and the delivery of your work in different formats.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-20).
### Software and Hardware List
